# internal_pump_leakage
Multi-class classification to predict whether there is no leakage, weak leakage, or sever leakage.

There are 3 files in this repository, namely:
- internal_pump_leakage.ipynb which contains the model.
- raw_to_simplified_data.ipynb which contains code to simplify raw data which has too many features
- pump_leakage_1.csv contains simplified data and will be used for modeling
- raw data can be taken from:https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mayank1897/condition-monitoring-of-hydraulic-systems?select=description.txt
